# NeoVim dotfiles

This repo contains my current dotfiles. I decided to start from scratch with a minimal setup and chose to follow [Josean Martinez's excellent start guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAG3BHurdM) as a starting point.

## Plugins I didn't install

There were some plugins I decided not to install yet:

- treesitter: while this looks useful I want to try using nvim without it to start with and see if I miss any of the functionality it offers
- indent-guides: I think I will install this at some point, however vim comes with built-in support for this that might be all I need
- autocomplete: I want to try setting up copilot for autocomplete first and then see if this is required after that
- autopairs: I _am_ using this, but haven't included autocomplete functionality
- substitute: I will install this at some point, but don't want to add too much before I've been using nvim for a bit
- surround: Same as above, I'll install this later
